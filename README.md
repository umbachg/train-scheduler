This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Why the Project is Useful ###
The app fulfilled a project assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. It provided me with the opportunity to learn about the following things:
* Cookies
* Sessions
* sessionStorage
* localStorage
* Server side storage
* Firebase
* event.preventDefault();
* momentJS
* Handling errors
